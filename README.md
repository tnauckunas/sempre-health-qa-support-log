 Sempre Health QA Support Portfolio

This repository documents my real-world QA and technical support experience from my role at **Sempre Health** (2020–2022), where I worked on Bluetooth-integrated medical devices paired with iPads for patient monitoring.

I supported hardware/software validation, conducted black box testing, and collaborated with internal teams to identify and document faults. This repo simulates structured test documentation, logs, and lessons learned.
