# Sempre Health QA Support Portfolio  
**Author:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Role:** Field QA / Technician (2020–2022)  
**Status:** Public documentation of real-world QA work in medical device environments

## Overview

This repository documents my direct QA and technical support experience at Sempre Health, where I worked with Bluetooth-enabled medical devices, iPads, and accessibility joysticks deployed to real patients.

I conducted black box testing, device validation, user feedback logging, and field-level troubleshooting to ensure seamless performance across hardware, app, and cloud sync layers.

This repo simulates and logs what I practiced: **full-cycle QA** — from setup → sync → user behavior → device return → engineering feedback loop.

## Key Focus Areas

- Device integration (iPadOS + BLE pairing)
- Real user onboarding patterns and failure points
- Accessibility hardware (joystick input + UI response)
- App behavior, firmware mismatches, and cloud sync failures
- Field-level RMA, QA documentation, and issue tracking

## Folder Structure

| Folder             | Contents |
|--------------------|----------|
| `/manual-tests/`   | Structured test cases (device pairing, iPad integration, joystick input validation) |
| `/troubleshooting/`| Field issue logs, sync failures, firmware bug reports, joystick misreads |
| `/docs/`           | SOPs, user interaction notes, return workflows, admin insights |
| `/assets/`         | (optional) Diagrams, photos, screenshots for future uploads

- **joystick_visual_integration.md** – Advanced UI + sensor testing via admin panel  
- **data_sync_issues.md** – End-to-end cloud sync tracking with failure scenarios  
- **firmware_faults.md** – Field log + resolution of low-level firmware bugs  
- **device_failure_log.md** – Hardware replacements and QA patterns  
- **joystick_issues.md** – Input ghosting, spatial drift, and batch-level hardware faults  
- **issue_summary_log.md** – Cross-system analysis + improvement feedback  
- **user_interaction_notes.md** – Human insight from patient support sessions  
- **return_process_flowchart.md** – End-to-end return & RMA protocol I helped revise

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- Manual + black box QA  
- BLE integration testing  
- iPadOS configuration  
- App + peripheral debugging  
- QA documentation + pattern logging  
- Admin/debug tool utilization  
- Field support & technician workflows  
- Accessibility device validation (joystick → 3D avatar sync)

## Lessons Carried Forward

- Real users introduce more complexity than hardware ever will  
- QA needs logs, not guesses — structure wins  
- “It works” is not enough — if it doesn’t sync, log, and visualize properly, it’s broken  
- User trust begins with visual feedback and reliable input handling

## Future Plans

This repo serves as my **foundational QA portfolio**, documenting field-level quality control with medical-grade systems. My next goal is to build automation frameworks and API test suites that follow the same standard of real-world value and failure-prevention logic.
