## Common Integration Issues Found

| Issue | Description | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| App crash on launch | Happened on iPadOS 14.1 | Reinstalled, confirmed fixed in app v2.3 |
| Dashboard data delay | Sync >10s on Gen 6 | Re-paired device, confirmed battery lag |
| Bluetooth not auto-connecting | iPad didn’t retain pairing | Removed old connections, rebooted device |
| Incomplete setup on TestFlight build | App stuck on “Searching...” | Cleared TestFlight cache, reinstalled |

## Post-Test Actions

- Flagged iPadOS 14.1 as unreliable for rollout  
- Created pre-deployment checklist to include:
  - OS version audit  
  - Bluetooth pairing confirmation  
  - App version consistency  
  - Patient dashboard test  
- Helped define SOP for field techs handling iPad kits

## Lessons Learned

- iOS updates often break integration in subtle ways and don’t trust it without testing  
- Apps must be tested **freshly installed**, not just “opened again”  
- Always test **battery % + permissions** as invisible blockers  
- Consistency between app version and firmware is critical to sync
