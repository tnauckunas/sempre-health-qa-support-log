## Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Fault Identified**
   - Client reports issue or is flagged during pre-deployment testing  
   - Description logged: symptoms, device ID, firmware version  

2. **Initial Troubleshooting**
   - Onsite support runs checklist:
     - Power cycle  
     - App reinstallation  
     - Bluetooth re-pairing  
     - Firmware version check  
   - Resolution attempted live if possible  

3. **Device Flagged for Return**
   - If unresolved after 2 attempts → Device tagged for RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization)  
   - Internal ticket created  
   - Device pulled from deployment queue

4. **Documentation**
   - Issue summary entered into return log  
   - QA notes added: suspected cause, attempted fixes, observed behavior  
   - Photos/screenshots attached if relevant

5. **Physical Return**
   - Device packaged in secure return envelope  
   - RMA code attached  
   - Courier scheduled  
   - Chain of custody form signed

6. **Post-Return Analysis**
   - Engineering/QA team evaluates returned unit  
   - Cross-reference return data with field notes  
   - Fault confirmed or escalated

7. **Final Log Update**
   - Resolution documented: repair, replacement, or firmware patch required  
   - Tracker closed  
   - Device either re-integrated or disposed

## Checklist Used During Process

- Device label + serial logged  
- Bluetooth pairing logs captured  
- Screenshot of failure if possible  
- Firmware version confirmed  
- Return packaging verified  
- Ticket ID linked to customer profile

## Notes

Creating and following this process drastically reduced missing information, increased accountability, and helped Sempre’s engineering team fix systemic issues faster.  
I personally handled over 30+ device returns and helped revise the SOP used by new techs in the field.
